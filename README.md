# Energy-Price-Prediction-for-the-state-of-Illinois
This project is part of the Deep Learning course milestone, focusing on the exploration and analysis of energy price trends across different states. Using visualization and statistical methods, the notebook provides insights into energy pricing over time and compares trends among various regions.

## Project Overview
The dataset includes energy prices across multiple hubs, recorded over time. This project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and outliers.
- Visualizations to compare pricing trends across states.
- Regression and deep learning models to predict energy prices.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**:
  - Grouped data by time (months, days, hours) to analyze trends.
  - Analyzed price distributions for specific hubs like Illinois.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Monthly and daily energy price trends across hubs.
  - Hourly average prices and their fluctuations.
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Linear Regression and XGBoost models for price prediction.
  - Deep learning models implemented using TensorFlow/Keras for enhanced accuracy.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques to optimize model performance.
